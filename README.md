# CutterAttacherHeight for Farming Simulator 2017

## Description
This mod will automatically adjust the cutting height.
Additionally, you can change the height of the lowered state itself. 
You should only make sure that you lowered the cutter at a reasonably flat area. 
Here's the key assignment: 
* Shift + H ----- Automatic on / off (default on) 
* Shift + N ----- cutting high 
* Shift + J ----- cutting down 

That works together with the helper, as when lifting the cutting unit (press V) it still goes to the top.
